This is our Initial approach that we used to parallelize the probelm. 
What we've done in this section includes,
1. Setting up Mesh in parallel for both 1D and 2D
2. Implement the Assembly for Mass Matrix, Stiffness Matrix and Right hand side of Poisson Equation in Parallel for both 1D and 2D
3. Solving function with Gaussian Quadrature in parallel for both 1D and 2D

RESULTS: For the initial method our results for both matrices are very good. But what we lack is local numbering for setting up the matrix which was attempted in next



In order to run the program

1. Type (make 1D) to run 1D problem
2. Type (make 2D) to run 2D problem
